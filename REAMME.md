  **Our aim in this experiment is to write a pair of functions** 
*[ **functions are	"makeCacheMatrix" and "cacheSolve" that cache the inverse of a matrix** ]*
1. makeCacheMatrix is a function which creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse for the input (which is an invertible square matrix)

2. cacheSolve is a function which computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache
